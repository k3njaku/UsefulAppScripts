This script is an Google Apps Script that retrieves a URL from the Bing API using the UrlFetchApp service and returns the URL to the calling function. Here's a breakdown of what each line does:

var url = 'https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search?q=' + accountName + '+' + state + '+' + revenue; - This line constructs the query string for the Bing search API by concatenating the base URL with the parameters q, accountName, state, and revenue. The resulting URL will look something like https://api.bing.microsoft.com/v7.0/search?q=ACME+Inc%20CA%201000000.
var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, {'headers': {'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key': 'fa6661f0b65c4712a0d9d570fdd349a4'}}); - This line fetches the URL using the UrlFetchApp service and passes in a set of headers, including an API key for authentication.
var json = JSON.parse(response.getContentText()); - This line parses the response content as JSON data.
var companyURL = json.webPages.value[0].url; - This line extracts the first result from the JSON data and gets its URL property. The resulting URL will be in the format http://www.example.com.
return companyURL; - This line returns the extracted URL back to the calling function.
The function takes three parameters: accountName, state, and revenue. These are used to construct the query string for the Bing search API. The function returns a single value, which is the URL of the first result returned by the API.
